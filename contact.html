Step 1: Define the Subject & Core Structure
Goal: Tell the AI exactly what the image is.

Prompt Segment: A high-fidelity, detailed web design for a "Contact Us" page.

Explanation: This sets the stage. We are not asking for a photo, a painting, or an abstract concept, but a web design mockup, ensuring the AI focuses on UI/UX elements like input fields, buttons, and text blocks. The term "high-fidelity" is crucial for a clean, non-sketchy final result.

Step 2: Establish the Aesthetic & Color Palette
Goal: Capture the mood, color, and lighting.

Prompt Segment: A sleek, dark-mode theme with a black or very dark gray background. The primary accent color is a rich teal or turquoise, used for buttons and key highlights. Secondary accent is a striking crimson or deep red for urgent call-to-action areas.

Explanation: This is where we lock in the style.

Dark-mode: Matches the original.

Color Palette: Identifies the key colors: Dark Gray/Black (background), Teal/Turquoise (primary interactive color), and Crimson/Red (emergency color). This is vital for authenticity.

"Sleek" promotes a modern, streamlined look.

Step 3: Detail the Layout and Content Boxes
Goal: Describe the two main content sections.

Prompt Segment: The page is divided into two columns/main sections. **Left Section (Form):** Titled "Send us a Message," containing four simple, outlined input fields for Full Name, Email Address, Subject, and Message (a larger text area). The submission button at the bottom is in the teal accent color and labeled "Send Message."

Explanation: This defines the left half. Using terms like "two columns" and specifying the form fields ensures the core structure is maintained.

Step 4: Detail the Contact Information Block
Goal: Describe the right-hand content section and its icons.

Prompt Segment: **Right Section (Information):** Titled "Contact Information," featuring a list of four items, each with a small, relevant icon: Address (🌎/📍), Emergency (📞), Email (✉️), and Legal Support (⚖️).

Explanation: This covers the top right section. Explicitly mentioning the icons helps the AI generate visual placeholders that are true to the original.

Step 5: Detail the Emergency Call-out Box
Goal: Capture the prominent red crisis box.

Prompt Segment: Below the Contact Information, there is a prominent, rectangular, crimson red block. Inside, the text reads "In Crisis?" followed by "Immediate help is available 24/7." At the bottom of this red block, a white, contrasting button is labeled "Call Helpline Now."

Explanation: This is the most visually distinct element. Specifying the color (crimson red), the contrast (white button), and the copy makes it unmistakable.

Step 6: Add Technical/Artistic Modifiers
Goal: Refine the quality, style, and atmosphere.

Prompt Segment: Minimalist design, clean typography (sans-serif), soft ambient lighting, UI/UX design, highly detailed, 4k resolution.

Explanation: These are the "artistic flavor" adjustments.

Minimalist/Clean Typography: Keeps it professional and easy to read.

Soft ambient lighting: Prevents it from looking flat and adds depth.

UI/UX design, 4k resolution: Standard modifiers to request a professional, high-quality output.
